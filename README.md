# Vacuum-Food-Keepbox

This product is a **modular vacuum food container system** designed to help extend the freshness of stored foods by reducing oxygen in the container, supporting better storage practice and reducing reliance on single-use wraps and bags.

The system is built around a **replaceable, upgradable architecture**: the lid, seal path/gasket, one-way valve, and pump module are designed as modules that can be swapped, repaired, and redesigned. All key parts can be modified using the provided **editable CAD source files** (not just exports), making it easy to iterate and develop your own version.

To support replication and customization, we provide a clear **BOM with sourcing** so you can purchase off-the-shelf components directly and adapt the design around what you can access. The repository also includes **assembly instructions** and **user guidance** (operation, maintenance, and safety notes) to help you build and use the system correctly.

## What you’ll find in this repo
- CAD (editable sources + exports)
- BOM (parts + sourcing links)
- Docs (assembly guide, user guide, maintenance & safety)
- Tests (raw data, plots, pass/fail checks)
