# Vacuum-Food-Keepbox
KeepBox is an open-source, repairable vacuum food container system designed to reduce food waste and cut reliance on single-use wraps and bags. The project publishes editable CAD source files (not just exports) so others can study, modify, manufacture, and share improved versions.
