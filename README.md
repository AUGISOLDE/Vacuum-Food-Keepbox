# Vacuum-Food-Keepbox

This product is a **modular vacuum food container system** that helps extend the freshness of stored foods by reducing oxygen inside the container, while reducing reliance on single-use wraps and bags.

The design is **open-source and fully modular**: the lid, seal/gasket path, one-way valve, and pump module are all intended to be replaceable, repairable, and easy to redesign. We provide **editable CAD source files** (not just exports) so you can directly modify the design and build improved versions.

To support replication and customization, the repository includes a **BOM with sourcing** so you can purchase off-the-shelf components and adapt the system to your own needs. We also provide **manuals** (assembly + user guide) to help you build, operate, and maintain the system safely.

## Repo contents
- CAD (editable sources + exports)
- BOM (parts + sourcing)
- Manuals (assembly guide, user guide, maintenance & safety)
